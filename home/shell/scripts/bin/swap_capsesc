# For my Laptop, I'm swapping the CAPS and ESC keys via `gsettings`.
# However, for my external keyboard, these keys are swapped using QMK.
#
# The problem is that whenever I connect the external keyboard to the
# laptop, the laptop's settings "revert" QMK's settings.
#
# Ideally, this should be done using `udev` rules, but since `udev` runs
# as root, I haven't figured a way to run `gsettings`.
