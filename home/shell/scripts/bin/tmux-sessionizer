# Slightly modified version of ThePrimeagean's tmux-sessionizer script:
# https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/bin/tmux-sessionizer
#
# Uses `zoxide` to get your most frequently used directories inside your projects directory
# and `fzf` to further filter this list.
#
# It then creates a `tmux` session named after the selected project and attaches to it.
#
# The first pane is named "main" for integration with the tmux-harpoon script.
#
#
# Requirements: fzf, zoxide, fd
#

# Where are your projects located
PROJECTS_DIR="$HOME/Projects"

# Find the most frequently accessed projects via `zoxide and filter them`
